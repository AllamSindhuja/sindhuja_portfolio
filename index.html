                    Hello! I'm Sindhuja Allam, a Computer Science master's student at Saint Louis University. I'm really into making computers learn from data (machine learning) and understanding how computers can understand human language (NLP). I've worked on cool projects using these technologies and even did an internship focusing on language stuff. Check out my portfolio to see some of the interesting things I've done, from creating smart algorithms to exploring the wonders of language. I'm always up for new projects and collaborations, so let's chat and create some awesome things together!

                My life is like a big, colorful picture made up of things I love doing every day. I enjoy painting, taking pictures, and dancing â€“ each one adding its own special touch to my interests. I also really love traveling because it lets me explore different cultures and see the world from a wide perspective. Besides all this fun stuff, I'm also into activities that help make a positive impact on society. I dream of creating a trust that helps people in need and makes the world a better place. Putting all these interests together, I'm building a future where what I love to do also helps others
